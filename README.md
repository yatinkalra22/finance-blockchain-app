# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
Install client -
$ cd client
$ npm i && nam start

Install hardhat
$ npm i --legacy-peer-deps

Run hardhat 
$ npx hardhat compile 
$ npx hardhat node  

To have updated ABI contract in client
$  node extractABI.js  

Run blockchain locally
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost


Other useful commands - 

npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
